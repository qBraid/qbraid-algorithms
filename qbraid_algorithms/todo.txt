QasmBuilder:
finish scoping and validate building import file generation

GateLibrary:
look into better controlled application 
- ie some static std_gate calls only accept a target. Current workaround is to directly call the gate name. 
- - look at either adding args/kwargs to static gate passthrough or having behavior returning gate name on call with null
- - a decorator might be another way
reformalize ancilla claiming
- probable temp practice is that any function that can claim ancilla must work within root file (base builder) scope as a subroutine rather than gate, 
means that only update would be safety checking certain calls when not established in header (ie defined within body so ordering of definitions may be wrong)
- would also mean updating qpe, select/prep as they are in gate formalism currently due to lack of rendering support for subroutines

Ambiguous:
pragma annotations in general
-specifically one for 0 state ancilla postselection?
